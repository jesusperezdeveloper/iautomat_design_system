## Flutter SDK version (project)

This project is pinned to Flutter 3.35.3. To ensure consistent builds use one
of the following tools to switch your local Flutter SDK:

- FVM (recommended):
	- Install FVM: `dart pub global activate fvm` or follow https://fvm.app
	- Run `fvm use 3.35.3` in the repository root.
- asdf (alternative):
	- Add `flutter` plugin and run `asdf install flutter 3.35.3`.
- Simple switch: create a `.flutter-version` file with `3.35.3` (already present).

After switching, run `flutter pub get` (or `fvm flutter pub get`) in the repo root
and in `example/`.
